👋 Hi there, I’m Chinanu Martin Ohanyere

Welcome to my GitHub!
I’m a Data Analyst who loves exploring how data can tell stories that lead to better decisions. My background in engineering and healthcare shaped how I see data, not just as numbers, but as a way to understand people, systems, and impact.

Here, you’ll find projects where I’ve applied Power BI, SQL, and Excel to solve real-world problems. From analyzing patient health records and healthcare costs to visualizing global trends like COVID-19 and diabetes risk. Each project is a chance to learn something new, refine my skills, and turn insights into clarity.

🔍 What I’m passionate about

   - Building dashboards that make complex data easy to understand.

   - Turning messy data into meaningful insights.

   - Exploring how data analytics can improve healthcare and business outcomes.

   - Growing my skills in SQL, Power BI, and advanced data modeling.
